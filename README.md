# Market Analysis of New Coders
In this project, we will be taking a look at the open [dataset](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey) 
from freeCodeCamp's 2017 survey of more than 20,000 developers. The analysis will be done in a hypothetical situation 
where an online education company with a subscription fee of 59 USD is attempting to find out which educational contentin coding 
it should create and which countries it should advertise in.
